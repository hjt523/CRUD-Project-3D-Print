# CRUD-Project-3D-Print

This is the GIT repository for my QA Training Academy project due on the 24th of May.

My Idea is a CRUD application for keeping track of 3D prints for my personal printer. Effectively, it has to be able to start a print project ( create), do test runs with the material (create), at different temperatures and retraction settings depending upon outcome ( update), maybe hold some comments on prior temperatures (create/update), so i can monitor the progress of the task (read) and finally close down the tests and print project when complete ( delete).
